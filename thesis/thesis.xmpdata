\Title{Mahalanobis based hierarchical clustering accelerated on GPU}
\Keywords{clustering\sep  high-dimensional data\sep GPU}
\Subject{During a clustering of a flow-cytometry data, the Mahalanobis distance function is used to form elliptical clusters naturally. However, reasonably computable dataset sizes are restricted to a factor of 100K points due to~the~polynomial time and space complexity of the current algorithm. In this thesis, we researched possible ways of implementing clustering algorithms and proposed an~implementation of Mahalanobis-based hierarchical clustering analysis accelerated on a single GPU. Using CUDA platform we achieved the performance increase of up to 5000-times on single-point datasets and 40-times on apriori datasets compared to a serial CPU counterpart. With this contribution, the size of flow cytometry datasets can increase to millions of points.}
