Clustering analysis as a method of unsupervised learning technique has become well spread over many fields of science nowadays. Originated in anthropology, clustering analysis (clustering) is the task of organizing set of objects into such sub-sets that they show a kind of similarity. 

Clustering has a great foundation in machine learning but can be recently found in the field of molecular biology as well~\cite{Nugent2010}. Although this field has many opportunities for using machine learning algorithms to advance the research~\cite{btaa091}, potential of clustering in molecular biology is restricted by the size of a working dataset. Reasonably computable dataset sizes vary from 10 000 to 100 000 objects due to the polynomial complexity of used algorithms. One way to increase this size is incorporating computing power of graphical processing units (GPUs) into the algorithms. For example, \citet{andrade2013g} showed that GPU implemention of DBSCAN \footnote{Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise} can be over 100-times faster than its sequential CPU counterpart. With this possible performance increase, researchers can use datasets with milions of objects. 

To this day, there is a gap in GPU alternatives of this algorithms. In the present thesis, we implement hierarchical clustering with Mahalanobis based distance variation on GPU and test its performance. In this manner, the thesis firstly describes different variations of clustering algorithms with addition to some possible optimizations.
